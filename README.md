# Order Execution Engine

A high-performance order execution engine for trading systems that matches buy and sell orders efficiently using price-time priority.

## Features

- **Order Types**: Support for MARKET, LIMIT, STOP, and STOP_LIMIT orders
- **Order Matching**: Automatic matching of buy and sell orders based on price-time priority
- **Order Book**: Real-time order book visualization for any trading pair
- **Trade Execution**: Automatic trade execution when orders match
- **REST API**: Comprehensive RESTful API for order management
- **Database**: MongoDB for persistent storage
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging with Winston
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Logging**: Winston

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (v5 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Eterna_Labs
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and configure your MongoDB connection:
```
# Either set a full connection string:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017

# Or rely on host/port fallbacks:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=27017
DB_NAME=order_engine
```

4. Set up the database (ensures collections and indexes exist):
```bash
# Option 1: Using the setup script (recommended)
npm run setup:db

# Option 2: Using the shell script (requires mongosh)
./setup-db.sh

# Option 3: Manual check
mongosh "${MONGODB_URI:-mongodb://localhost:27017}" --eval "db.getSiblingDB('${DB_NAME:-order_engine}').orders.stats()"
```

5. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

6. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

For development with hot reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints

### Orders

#### Create Order
```http
POST /api/v1/orders
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "user123",
  "symbol": "BTC/USD",
  "side": "BUY",
  "type": "LIMIT",
  "quantity": 10,
  "price": 50000,
  "timeInForce": "GTC"
}
```

#### Get Order by ID
```http
GET /api/v1/orders/:id
```

#### Get Orders by User
```http
GET /api/v1/users/:userId/orders
```

#### Cancel Order
```http
DELETE /api/v1/orders/:id
```

#### Get Pending Orders
```http
GET /api/v1/orders/pending?symbol=BTC/USD
```

#### Get Order Book
```http
GET /api/v1/orderbook/:symbol
```

### Trades

#### Get Recent Trades
```http
GET /api/v1/trades?limit=100
```

#### Get Trades by Symbol
```http
GET /api/v1/trades/symbol/:symbol?limit=100
```

#### Get Trades by Order ID
```http
GET /api/v1/trades/order/:orderId
```

### Health Check
```http
GET /health
```

## Order Types

### MARKET
Executes immediately at the best available price. No price required.

### LIMIT
Executes only at the specified price or better. Price is required.

### STOP
Becomes a market order when the stop price is reached. Stop price is required.

### STOP_LIMIT
Becomes a limit order when the stop price is reached. Both stop price and limit price are required.

## Order Sides

- **BUY**: Buy order (bid)
- **SELL**: Sell order (ask)

## Order Status

- **PENDING**: Order is waiting to be matched
- **PARTIALLY_FILLED**: Order has been partially executed
- **FILLED**: Order has been completely executed
- **CANCELLED**: Order has been cancelled
- **REJECTED**: Order was rejected (e.g., market order with no matches)

## Time in Force

- **GTC** (Good Till Cancel): Order remains active until cancelled
- **IOC** (Immediate or Cancel): Order must be filled immediately or cancelled
- **FOK** (Fill or Kill): Order must be filled completely or cancelled

## Matching Logic

The engine uses **price-time priority**:

1. **Price Priority**: Better prices are matched first
   - For BUY orders: Higher prices have priority
   - For SELL orders: Lower prices have priority

2. **Time Priority**: Among orders with the same price, earlier orders are matched first

## Testing

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

                     # Ignored by git (see .gitignore)
```

### Understanding `src/` vs `dist/`

- **`src/`**: Your TypeScript source code - **This is where you write code**
- **`dist/`**: Compiled JavaScript - **Auto-generated by `npm run build`**
- **Both are needed**: `src/` for development, `dist/` for running the app
- **`dist/` is in `.gitignore`**: It's regenerated automatically, so it's not committed to git

## Database Collections

### `orders` Collection
- `id` / `_id`: UUID string (used for lookups)
- `userId`: User identifier
- `symbol`: Trading pair (e.g., BTC/USD)
- `side`: BUY or SELL
- `type`: MARKET, LIMIT, STOP, or STOP_LIMIT
- `quantity`: Order quantity
- `price`: Limit price (for LIMIT orders)
- `stopPrice`: Stop price (for STOP/STOP_LIMIT orders)
- `filledQuantity`: Amount already filled
- `status`: Current order status
- `timeInForce`: GTC, IOC, or FOK
- `createdAt` / `updatedAt`: ISO timestamps

### `trades` Collection
- `id` / `_id`: UUID string
- `buyOrderId`: Reference to buy order
- `sellOrderId`: Reference to sell order
- `symbol`: Trading pair
- `quantity`: Trade quantity
- `price`: Execution price
- `timestamp`: Trade execution time

## Logging

Logs are written to:
- `logs/error.log`: Error logs
- `logs/combined.log`: All logs

Log level can be configured via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

## Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `201`: Created
- `400`: Bad Request (validation errors)
- `404`: Not Found
- `500`: Internal Server Error

## Performance Considerations

- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Efficient order matching algorithm
- Connection pooling for database
- Async/await for non-blocking operations

## Future Enhancements

- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Order depth visualization
- Advanced order types (Iceberg, TWAP, etc.)
- Multi-symbol support with better indexing
- Redis caching for order book
- Rate limiting and authentication
- Order history and analytics
